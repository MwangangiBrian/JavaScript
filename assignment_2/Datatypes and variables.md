JavaScript Data Types and Variables

## 1. Data Types and Variables

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means variables can hold different types of data over time. Understanding the various data types and how variables work is fundamental to mastering JavaScript.

### Data Types in JavaScript

JavaScript has seven primitive data types:
1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Undefined
5. Null
6. Symbol (added in ES6)
7. BigInt (added in ES2020)
8. Object

### Variable Declaration: var, let, and const:


1. **var**:
   - Function-scoped or globally-scoped
   - Can be redeclared and updated
   ```javascript
   var x = 5;
   var x = 10; // Valid redeclaration
   x = 15;     // Valid reassignment
   ```

2. **let** (introduced in ES6):
   - Block-scoped
   - Can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope
   ```javascript
   let y = 5;
   y = 10;     // Valid reassignment
   let y = 15; // Invalid redeclaration (will throw an error)
   ```

3. **const** (introduced in ES6):
   - Block-scoped
   - Cannot be updated or redeclared
   - Must be initialized at declaration
   ```javascript
   const z = 5;
   z = 10;     // Invalid reassignment (will throw an error)
   const z = 15; // Invalid redeclaration (will throw an error)
   ```

### Dynamic Typing

JavaScript's dynamic typing allows variables to hold different types of data:

```javascript
let variable = 5;        // Number
variable = "Hello";      // String
variable = true;         // Boolean
variable = [1, 2, 3];    // Array (Object)
variable = {name: "John"}; // Object
```

### Uninitialized Variables

Variables declared without initialization are assigned the value 'undefined':

```javascript
let uninitializedVar;
console.log(uninitializedVar); // Output: undefined
```

### Importance of Variable Names

- Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose or content of the variable
- Follow camelCase convention for variable names
- Avoid reserved keywords and overly short or cryptic names

```javascript
// Good
let userAge = 25;
let isLoggedIn = true;

// Avoid
let a = 25;
let flag = true;
```

## 2. Numeric Data Types

JavaScript uses a single number type to represent all numbers, whether integers or floating-point.

### Types of Numbers

1. **Integers**: Whole numbers without a decimal point
   ```javascript
   let int = 42;
   ```

2. **Floating-point numbers**: Numbers with decimal points
   ```javascript
   let float = 3.14159;
   ```

3. **Exponential notation**: For very large or small numbers
   ```javascript
   let exp = 5e3; // 5000
   ```

4. **Special numeric values**:
   - `Infinity`: Represents positive infinity
   - `-Infinity`: Represents negative infinity
   - `NaN`: "Not a Number", result of undefined or erroneous operations

   ```javascript
   console.log(1 / 0);  // Infinity
   console.log(-1 / 0); // -Infinity
   console.log("hello" / 2); // NaN
   ```

### Arithmetic Operations

JavaScript handles arithmetic operations between different numeric types seamlessly:

```javascript
let result = 5 + 3.14;  // 8.14
```

## 3. String Data Type

Strings in JavaScript are sequences of characters used to represent text.

### String Representation

Strings can be enclosed in single quotes (''), double quotes (""), or backticks (``):

```javascript
let singleQuoted = 'Hello';
let doubleQuoted = "World";
let backticks = `Hello World`;
```

### Single vs Double Quotes

There's no functional difference between single and double quotes. The choice is often a matter of personal or stylistic preference:

```javascript
let str1 = 'JavaScript';
let str2 = "JavaScript";
console.log(str1 === str2); // true
```

### Template Literals

Backticks allow for multi-line strings and embedded expressions:

```javascript
let name = "Alice";
let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!
Welcome to JavaScript.`;
```

### Characters as Strings

In JavaScript, there is no separate character type. Single characters are treated as one-character strings:

```javascript
let char = 'A';
console.log(typeof char); // "string"
```

## 4. Boolean and Undefined Data Types

### Boolean

Boolean represents a logical entity with two values: `true` or `false`.

```javascript
let isActive = true;
let isLoggedOut = false;
```

Booleans are crucial in conditional statements and control flow:

```javascript
if (isActive) {
    console.log("User is active");
} else {
    console.log("User is inactive");
}
```

### Undefined

`undefined` is a primitive value automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but not initialized:

```javascript
let uninitializedVar;
console.log(uninitializedVar); // undefined
```

It's also the default return value of functions that don't explicitly return anything:

```javascript
function noReturn() {}
console.log(noReturn()); // undefined
```

## 5. Null Data Type

`null` is a special value that represents the intentional absence of any object value.

### Null vs Undefined

- `null` is explicitly assigned, while `undefined` is automatically assigned
- `null` is of type "object", while `undefined` is of type "undefined"

```javascript
let nullVar = null;
console.log(typeof nullVar); // "object"

let undefinedVar;
console.log(typeof undefinedVar); // "undefined"
```

### Use of Null

`null` is often used to explicitly indicate that a variable is empty or has no value:

```javascript
let user = null; // User not yet loaded or logged out
```

## 6. Object Data Type

Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs.

### Object Structure

Objects are defined using curly braces `{}`:

```javascript
let person = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30,
    isStudent: false
};
```

### Accessing Object Properties

Properties can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation:

```javascript
console.log(person.name);    // "John Doe"
console.log(person['age']);  // 30
```

### Nested Objects

Objects can contain other objects, allowing for complex data structures:

```javascript
let employee = {
    name: "Jane Smith",
    position: "Developer",
    address: {
        street: "123 Main St",
        city: "Anytown",
        country: "USA"
    }
};
```

## 7. Array Data Type

Arrays are objects used to store multiple values in a single variable.

### Array Structure

Arrays use square brackets `[]` and are zero-indexed:

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
```

### Accessing Array Elements

Elements are accessed by their index:

```javascript
console.log(fruits[0]); // "apple"
console.log(fruits[2]); // "orange"
```

### Mixed Data Types in Arrays

Arrays can contain elements of different types:

```javascript
let mixed = [1, "two", true, {name: "John"}, [5, 6]];
```

### Multidimensional Arrays

Arrays can contain other arrays, creating multidimensional structures:

```javascript
let matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
];
console.log(matrix[1][1]); // 5
```

## 8. Variable Naming Conventions

Proper naming conventions enhance code readability and maintainability.

### Best Practices

1. Use camelCase for variable and function names
2. Start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign
3. Be descriptive and meaningful
4. Avoid reserved keywords

```javascript
// Good
let firstName = "John";
let isUserLoggedIn = true;

// Avoid
let fn = "John";
let flag = true;
```

### Constants

Constants are often named in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES:

```javascript
const MAX_SIZE = 100;
const API_BASE_URL = "https://api.example.com";
```

## 9. Constants in JavaScript

The `const` keyword declares variables with a constant reference.

### Characteristics of Constants

- Must be initialized at declaration
- Cannot be reassigned after initialization
- Block-scoped like `let`

```javascript
const PI = 3.14159;
PI = 3; // Error: Assignment to a constant variable
```

### Constants with Objects and Arrays

For objects and arrays, `const` prevents reassignment of the reference, but the content can be modified:

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // Valid
arr = [5, 6, 7]; // Error: Assignment to a constant variable

const obj = {x: 1};
obj.y = 2; // Valid
obj = {z: 3}; // Error: Assignment to a constant variable
```
